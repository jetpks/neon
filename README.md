# Neon Installer

Neon is a software collection and configuration that allows you to use something
like a Raspberry Pi to act as an AirPlay target.


## Dirty Note

This installer project values dependency minimization over clean code. As a
result, there will be a lot of shelling out bash to accomplish things rather
than using the appropriate module from PyPi. Sorry, not sorry.
